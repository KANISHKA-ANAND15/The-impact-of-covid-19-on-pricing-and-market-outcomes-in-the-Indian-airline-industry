# The-impact-of-covid-19-on-pricing-and-market-outcomes-in-the-Indian-airline-industry
this is my First projecton Github and in This paper I have conducted an analysis on the impact of the COVID pandemic on the Indian airline industry. The industry faced
significant challenges, and regulatory measures were taken to alleviate the impact. The evidence indicates that the

to recover completely from the effects of COVID-19.
